MsEE,Multi-scale evolutionary engineering,Lab,,,,,,,,,,"Living systems pose challenges unique among engineering disciplines. When bioengineers design a new intervention, such as a treatment for disease or a pest control system in agriculture, the designed intervention interacts with complex biological systems‚Äîthe agents of disease or pests we are trying to protect against. These systems are capable of evolving, which in turn affects the performance of the designed intervention. To make things even more interesting, the products bioengineers create are often engineered cells, which themselves are subject to evolution. Because of this, bioengineers must plan for this continuous cycle of evolutionary consequences of their designs. We can find examples of the engineering challenges posed by evolution in the evolution of resistance to treatment in cancer, pathogens such as ‚Äúsuperbug‚Äù bacteria, and agricultural pests. Other examples include escape from immune responses in viruses, strain competition in microbiome engineering, genetic stability in synthetic biology, dead ends in directed evolution, and many more. </p><p> In light of this, bioengineers should consider the evolutionary consequences or ‚Äúrobustness‚Äù of their designs in the same way they consider other variables, such as toxicity or bioavailability. However, we currently lack methods to measure evolutionary robustness in a systematic, quantitative manner. Part of the challenge lies in the fact that evolution occurs across vast scales in biology: interactions at the molecular level only show their evolutionary consequences at the level of populations and ecosystems, and those high-level complex systems determine conditions and selection pressures that shape evolutionary events at the molecular level. </p><p> Because of this, MsEE lab researches questions about how multiscale interactions shape evolution, creates tools that allow us to observe, model, and intervene biological systems from the molecular to the metapopulation level, and applies these tools to specific real-world problems. Our goal with these questions, tools, and applications is to develop evolutionary engineering as a field, allowing the systematic design of evolving systems according to the rules that govern them in the same way that mechanical engineering describes how to design mechanical systems according to the laws of physics. To achieve this, we use the methods of synthetic biology and computational modeling. "

SynBio,Synthetic biology,Branch,,,,,,,,,MsEE,"Synthetic biology is a field of research that focuses on assembling systems with new biological functions, regardless of the original function of the parts used to create the system. The term was (re)invented and popularized in the 2000s to differentiate the field from earlier attempts at simpler genetic engineering done with a single transgenic gene at a time, with the goal of making biology as standardized, modular, and predictable as electronic circuits. </p><p> Since its creation, synthetic biology has found that biology is significantly more complex and ""messy"" than electronic circuits: biological systems interact and change each other's behavior constantly,  making modularization and predictability challenging. However, this complexity and ""messiness"" also gives biological systems useful properties that electronics cannot achieve, allowing for strategies such as directed evolution. </p><p> Finally, throughout this process of re-invention of synthetic biology, the field has developed an ever-growing suite of tools with which to build and study living cells with increasing precision and ease. MsEE lab uses these tools to explore one aspect of biological messiness: it's ability to evolve."
CompMod,Computational models,Branch,,,,,,,,,MsEE,"""What I cannot create, I do not understand"" has become a clich√© quote, but it is a helpful one. It implies that to test whether we understand something, we can try to build it. Computational simulations provide us with a way to quickly create, test, and refine models of how we think complex systems work. At MsEE Lab, we do this to study and engineer biological systems capable of evolution. We develop multi-scale, mechanistic computational models based on the known behaviors of units we can understand and measure, such as individual molecules or cell, and then use these models to simulate complex, emergent behaviors such as evolution. We then compare these results with data from real-world experiments or observational studies. If our models fit well and our understanding is correct, we can use modeling to evaluate the evolutionary robustness of different bioengineering design strategies. </p><p> The mechanistic, bottom-up approach to modeling is epistemologically different from that of machine learning, in which we start top-down from the real-world data and use it to make predictions about the future behavior of a system. Ultimately, both kinds of approaches are complementary: machine learning can inform mechanistic models with parameter values and shape model structure and design, while mechanistic models can orthogonally validate machine learning predictions, provide causal, interpretable understanding, and adapt predictions to contexts outside the training dataset. The combination of both approaches leads to powerful techniques such as simulation-based inference, capable of making predictions in contexts that neither would be able to make alone."
